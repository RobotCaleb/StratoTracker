StratoTracker
=====

A simple micro blog site that I will use for live updates of my balloon launches.

I wrote it so that It could be tested locally and deploy it to a [dotCloud][0] instance. To install locally, you probably want to run `npm install` and have [MongoDB][1] running. To deploy, `dotcloud push stratotracker`. Although, you might want to rename to your own project name.
